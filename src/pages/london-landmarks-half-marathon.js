              <p>
                I set to run a marathon as my new year{"'"}s resolution. Three years ago! And that
                is a lesson that if you really want something, eventually (after three years) you
                will have an opportunity!
              </p>
              <p>
                Seriously. Running marathons was never a priority for me. But I do enjoy running and
                I am constantly training for a lower pace and longer distances.

                LLHM will take place on 24th of March 2019. Roads will be closed and more than
                13,000 runners will be part of it.
              </p>
              <p>
                It will be a great path through central London that will start from Pall Mall to St
                Paulâ€™s Cathedral to the Tower of London to the London Eye and will eventually end by
                Downing Street.

                In order to join this marathon I (pinky)-promised Tommy
                {"'"}s that I will raise an amount of money. Those will be used by them to further
                their cause, fund more research and eventually reach their goals. You have goals
                too, you know how it is.
